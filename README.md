# container-images

Stock images for container virtual machines that behave like a small VM:
the official Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux images with
their own init system (systemd, or OpenRC on Alpine) and OpenSSH, ready to
run under the init of
[kernel-linux](https://github.com/gigahost-apps/kernel-linux) (interface
version 3, `init_system`). They are published on GHCR as
`ghcr.io/gigahost-apps/<name>:<version>`.

[`images.toml`](images.toml) lists them with their bases, the official
images on Docker Hub, pinned by digest. Each image's command is
`/sbin/init`, run as the container's init system; its `STOPSIGNAL` is the
signal on which that init shuts down cleanly (the kernel delivers no other
to it). Labels: `org.opencontainers.image.source`, `.title`, `.version`,
`.revision`, `cloud.gigahost.init-system` (`systemd` or `openrc`),
`cloud.gigahost.ssh-user` (`root`), `cloud.gigahost.minimum-memory-bytes`
and `cloud.gigahost.x86-64-level`.

An instance of an image needs at least its minimum memory: below it the
package manager is killed for memory (dnf on EL 9 needs more than
256 MiB without swap). Its host's CPU needs the image's x86-64
microarchitecture level: 1 is the baseline, 2 is x86-64-v2 (SSE4.2,
POPCNT), 3 is x86-64-v3 (AVX2, BMI2, FMA, MOVBE). Rocky Linux 10 and
AlmaLinux 10 are built for x86-64-v3, and their init dies at once on a
CPU without it (a pre-Haswell one, for instance).

What each image holds: the init system (with D-Bus on systemd), the
OpenSSH server, `iproute2`, `ping`, CA certificates, `curl`, `less`, a
small `vi`, `procps`, `sudo`, cron and the time zone data, and the
distribution's package manager set up for its usual mirrors. The base's
packages are upgraded when an image is built, so it holds its
distribution's updates of that day. There is no
kernel, boot loader, firmware, NetworkManager or cloud-init: the
platform's init configures `eth0`, the host name, `/etc/hosts` and
`/etc/resolv.conf` before the image's init starts, and nothing in the
image changes them. For a container machine the systemd images mask the
gettys (the console is the machine's log), `systemd-networkd`,
`systemd-resolved`, `systemd-timesyncd` (the guest clock is the host's
`kvm-clock`), `systemd-firstboot`, udev (`/sys` is read-only),
`systemd-remount-fs` and `networking.service`
([`common/masked-units`](common/masked-units)); Rocky and Alma leave
`dnf-makecache.timer` off (dnf refreshes its metadata itself when it is
run, and the hourly refresh takes about 190 MiB); Alpine runs no getty
and no `networking` service.

SSH: root logs in with the keys the platform writes to
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, never with a password
(`PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`, `PasswordAuthentication no`,
`KbdInteractiveAuthentication no`). sshd starts at boot.

Per instance: an image holds no SSH host keys and an empty
`/etc/machine-id`. Each instance makes its own host keys at its first
boot, before sshd starts (`gigahost-ssh-host-keys.service` on Debian and
Ubuntu, `sshd-keygen@.service` on Rocky and Alma, sshd's OpenRC service on
Alpine), and systemd makes its machine ID; both are kept on the instance's
disk from then on.

## Building and testing

```sh
scripts/build.sh [NAME[:VERSION]...]       # podman; tags localhost/gigahost-images/<name>:<version>
tests/structure.sh [NAME[:VERSION]...]     # checks the built images without booting them
tests/boot.sh --kernel DIR [NAME[:VERSION]...]
```

A bare name selects every version of it; no name selects every image.

`tests/structure.sh` checks that an image holds no host key, machine ID,
random seed or password hash, that the SSH policy is in force
(`sshd -T`, after `ssh-keygen -A` in a throwaway container), the masked
units, the services enabled at boot, the init at `/sbin/init`, the
packages above, that its C library and init need the x86-64 level
`images.toml` gives (their `x86 ISA needed` notes, read with `readelf`),
and the image's labels, command and stop signal.

`tests/boot.sh` boots each image as a container machine under QEMU with
KVM, with a kernel-linux release's `bzImage` and `initramfs.cpio.zst` in
`DIR` (kernel-linux's `scripts/build.sh` makes them). The root disk is the
image's files on ext4 (`mkfs.ext4 -d`; the init's unpack mode, which the
platform uses, is kernel-linux's to test). Each image boots three
instances, all at the image's minimum memory: two from fresh disks, the
second on QEMU's oldest CPU model of the image's x86-64 level (`kvm64`,
`Nehalem`, `Haswell-noTSX`), then the first again. Each must reach
`running` with no failed unit (OpenRC: every service of its runlevels
started), accept a throwaway key for root over SSH, run cron and
`crontab`, keep the platform's address, route and name server, and end
with a `poweroff` report when powered off from inside; the two instances
must have different host keys and machine IDs, and the first must keep
its own across its two boots. The last boot also reaches the package
mirrors (`apt-get update`, `dnf makecache`, `apk update`), finds no
package update pending (an image built days ago fails here: rebuild it),
and starts the service of every active systemd timer, each of which must
succeed with the system still `running`. It reports each image's boot
time to `running`, `MemAvailable` at its minimum memory and its
gzip-compressed size. It needs podman, `qemu-system-x86_64`, `/dev/kvm`,
`mkfs.ext4`, `ssh` and network access.

## Publishing

[CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) builds every image and runs
`tests/structure.sh` on pull requests and pushes. On `main` (a push, a
weekly scheduled run, which rebuilds the images with their distributions'
updates whether or not a base moved, or a run started by hand) it then
pushes the tested images to `ghcr.io/gigahost-apps/<name>:<version>` and
`:<version>-<YYYYMMDD>-<n>`, and writes `images.json` as a workflow
artifact and as the asset of a release `images-<YYYYMMDD>-<n>`, with the
same `n`: one more than the day's highest release. A dated tag that a
release names is never pushed again (a run that fails before its release
leaves dated tags that no release names, and the next run reuses them). The boot test does not run in CI: it
needs KVM and a kernel-linux build.

Each entry of `images.json` has the image's `name`, `version`,
`display_name`, `reference`, `digest`, `tag` (the dated tag, such as
`13-20261019-1`), `init`, `stop_signal`, `ssh_user`,
`minimum_memory_bytes` and `x86_64_level`. The `reference` is
`ghcr.io/gigahost-apps/<name>@sha256:<hex>`, repository and digest
without a tag, which names one image for good.

A weekly [workflow](.github/workflows/update-bases.yml) runs
`scripts/update-bases.sh`, which moves each base to the digest its tag
names now (and Alpine to its current release), and opens a pull request
when one moved.

For the maintainer:

- A package GHCR creates on a workflow's first push may start private.
  Set each package (`debian`, `ubuntu`, `alpine`, `rockylinux`,
  `almalinux`) public once, in its package settings; the images are meant
  to be pulled without credentials.
- GitHub turns a public repository's scheduled workflows off after 60
  days without activity in it; turn them on again in the Actions tab.
- The base-update workflow needs "Allow GitHub Actions to create and
  approve pull requests" in the repository's Actions settings. A pull
  request it opens does not start CI by itself (GitHub runs no workflow
  for the workflow token's events): close and reopen it, or push to its
  branch, to run the checks.
